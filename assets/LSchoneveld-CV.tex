		{Lead Data Scientist,} {\bf Powder} \hfill Oct 2019-Present\vspace{2mm}\newline
		Lead and implement the AI strategy at Powder:
		\vspace{1mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Research and develop Powder's videogame highlights detection system, which is highly scalable thanks to a unique (patent pending) approach applying self- and weakly-supervised learning to 1000s of hours of videogame footage.
			\item Active role in recruiting and onboarding new AI talent, communicating needs and results to management, and explaining Powder's AI strategy to investors.
			\item Lead Powder's research collaboration with Dr.  Alice Othmani at Universit\'e Paris-Est Cr\'eteil (UPEC), focusing on audiovisual emotion recognition.
		\end{itemize}
		
		{Data Scientist,} {\bf Pandascore} \hfill 2017-2019
		\vspace{1mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Developing and deploying computer vision models for real-time events and stats detection in e-sports (professional video games) tournaments.
			\item Training and deploying machine learning models using these computer vision-derived data to predict match outcomes in real time.
			\item Contributing to growth, product strategy and recruitment efforts.
		\end{itemize}
		
		{Machine Learning Specialist,} {\bf Scyfer (acquired by Qualcomm)} \hfill Feb-Sep 2017\vspace{1mm}\newline
		Completed my Artificial Intelligence (AI) masters' thesis under the supervision of Taco Cohen and Max Welling while interning at Scyfer, an AI consultancy acquired by Qualcomm in late 2017. Focus was on researching and developing semi-supervised deep learning techniques, with an emphasis on computer vision.
		
		{Econometrics Contractor,} {\bf LEK Consulting} \hfill 2016-2017\vspace{1mm}\newline
		Contracted to develop econometric revenue analysis and forecasting models for several assets belonging to a large (ASX top 50) Australian client of LEK.
		
		{Economics Consultant,} {\bf PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia} \hfill 2013-2016\vspace{1mm}\newline
		Consulted with clients primarily from the transport industry. Focus was on econometric and economic modelling (e.g. demand forecasting, cost-benefit analyses, project appraisal, etc.) and associated analysis and reporting.
		
		{Software Developer,} {\bf Law in Order Pty Ltd} \hfill 2010-2013\vspace{1mm}\newline
		Produced electronic databases of legal evidence for Law in Order's clients. Proposed, developed and maintained a quality assurance software tool that continued to be used at Law in Order many years after my departure.
